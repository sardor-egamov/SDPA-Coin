# SDPA Coin Market Simulation
## Introduction
The SDPA Coin Market Simulation project offers a dynamic and interactive simulation of a cryptocurrency market, named SDPA Coin. Designed to mimic the digital currency trading.

## Features
UserAccount Class: Simulates individual user accounts, enabling operations like buying/selling SDPA Coin, managing mining machines, and handling expenses.
BlockchainSystem Class: Acts as the core record-keeping mechanism, maintaining a transparent ledger of transactions and mined coins.
Market Class: Models real-time market dynamics, adjusting SDPA Coin's liquidity, supply, and pricing based on user activities.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Matplotlib (for visualization)
### Run Instructions
1) Clone this repository to your local machine.
2) Ensure Python and Matplotlib are installed.
3) Navigate to the repository directory and run main.py
4) Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the simulation.
## Design and Implementation
The simulation is built on object-oriented design principles, enhancing its modularity and scalability. Each class is assigned distinct responsibilities, facilitating ease of maintenance and future project expansion.

## Visualization
The simulation utilizes Matplotlib to graphically display trends in SDPA Coin prices and user asset values over time, offering a visual representation of market dynamics.

## Conclusion
This project serves as both an educational tool and a practical demonstration of cryptocurrency market mechanics, blockchain technology, and object-oriented programming.
